### The Internet


What is it?  Read and take notes then keep noticing.  As you code, continue to take note of when and how you come across the concepts you learned here.


* Outstanding introduction: [Foundations of the Web](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/foundations-of-the-web/)
* [Khan Academy's Intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro)
* [The Odin Project's intro](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/how-does-the-web-work)
* [Time-Lapse Maps of the Internet](https://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps) 
* [internet for webdevs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ).  And there's a part two.     
* [OSI model](http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp)
* Good videos: [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAPjr7vgxE)

HTTP:

### Browsers

In the simplest definition, a browser is an application that imports and renders HTML, CSS & JS from anywhere in the internet. 

* [LifeWire](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-browser-446234)
* [Foxy Video](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+web+browser&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT_fHmrubbAhWszIMKHYArAKUQ_AUICigB&biw=1280&bih=739)
* [Browser vs Search Engine](https://www.computer-geek.net/what-is-the-difference-be-va-47.html)

Besides just acting as search & rendering engines for content served over the internet, browsers come with built-in tools for inspecting and developing websites.  In this course you will learn to develop, debug & present your work through [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).

### JavaScript

JS is a [_programming language_](https://techterms.com/definition/programming_language), it is the meat in your cake.  JavaScript is a full programming language plus super powers.  Along with the standard functionalities of a programming language JavaScript can:
* Manipulate the DOM in your browser, making user interactions easy to handle
* Send and receive HTTP requests across the internet

You'll learn more about all these features later on in this course.  For now you'll on the basic features of JavaScript.

---

### HTML

HTML is a [_markup language_](https://techterms.com/definition/markup_language) used to define layout and appearance of your website.  At least until [HTML5](https://www.portent.com/blog/design-dev/html5-like-really-important.htm) came out.  HTML5 adds a lot of functionality to your markup, but is still not as powerful as JavaScript or CSS.

---

### CSS

CSS isn't quite a Markup Language, and isn't quite a programming language.  You can think of it as a tool for changing the way your looks without changing how it's structured in your source code.  [CSS is it's own strange beast](http://www.webmasterview.com/2017/11/css/), some love it and some hate it.

---

### Web Apps

In simplest words a web application is just software that its split across the internet.  The part you see runs on your computer, but it talks with other parts anywhere in the world using HTTP.   Those other parts usually do all the hard work.
