### The Internet


What is it?  Read and take notes then keep noticing.  As you code, continue to take note of when and how you come across the concepts you learned here.


* Outstanding introduction: [Foundations of the Web](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/foundations-of-the-web/)
* [Khan Academy's Intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro)
* [The Odin Project's intro](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/how-does-the-web-work)
* [Time-Lapse Maps of the Internet](https://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps) 
* [internet for webdevs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ).  And there's a part two.     
* [OSI model](http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp)
* Good videos: [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4S8zfLdLgQ), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAPjr7vgxE)

HTTP:

* [Easy HTTP](https://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/)

### Browsers

In the simplest definition, a browser is an application that imports and renders HTML, CSS & JS from anywhere in the internet.  Check out the resources below for a better overview.

* [LifeWire](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-browser-446234)
* [Foxy Video](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+web+browser&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT_fHmrubbAhWszIMKHYArAKUQ_AUICigB&biw=1280&bih=739)

### JS, HTML & CSS

These three tools are usually grouped together because they are all necessary to build interesting websites, but each one totally unique.

__JavaScript__

JS is a [_programming language_](https://techterms.com/definition/programming_language), it is the meat in your cake.  JavaScript is a full programming language with super powers.  Along with the standard functionalities of any programming language JavaScript can:
* Manipulate the DOM in your browser
* Send and receive HTTP requests
* Perform asynchronous operations
* Offload work to 3rd party services

You'll learn more about all these features later on in this bootcamp.  For now you'll just have to worry about the basics (functions, variables, control flow), and a little bit of DOM manipulation.


__HTML__

HTML is a [_markup language_](https://techterms.com/definition/markup_language) used to define layout and appearance of your website.  At least until [HTML5](https://www.portent.com/blog/design-dev/html5-like-really-important.htm) came out.  HTML5 adds a lot of functionality to your markup, but is still not as powerful as JavaScript or CSS.

__CSS__

CSS isn't quite a Markup Language, and isn't quite a programming language.  You can think of it as a tool for changing the way your looks without changing how it's structured in your source code.  [CSS is it's own strange beast](http://www.webmasterview.com/2017/11/css/), some love it and some hate it.

__Web Apps__

In simplest words a web application is just software that its split across the internet.  The part you see runs on your computer, but it talks with other parts anywhere in the world using HTTP.   Those other parts usually do all the hard work.
