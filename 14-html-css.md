## HTML & CSS

* create a new repo called 'fcc-html-css'. you'll use the readme to take notes.  you can include colored snippets of html in markdown, it's helpful
* complete the whole html & css in freecodecamp, include a screenshot
* open a new html repl.it to host all of your fcc final projects. Create a main index.html and one html file for each of your fcc projects. Turn the index.html into a table of contents for each project and put a link back to the index on each one. decorate said index page to you liking.  you now have a fully-navigable showcase of all your projects!
* Link to the replit from your portfolio.
* for extra practice with github, copy paste each of your completed fcc html projects into your fcc-html-css repo, creating a new file on a new branch before merging & tagging. as with the git/hub exercise


* link to this repo & the live gh-pages from your portfolio



## HTML & CSS

These are the tools that give your websites structure and make them pretty.  They're also easier to learn than JavaScript, and learning them first will make learning JS simpler later on.  So take some time now to build a few pretty projects using just HTML & CSS.

Keep your projects small and simple.  You will learn more from starting and finishing simpler projects than you will out of stumbling through fewer larger projects.

While you're building your projects, don't just focus on the finished product.  Focus on the journey.  This might sound corny, but the truth is that one of the biggest differences between beginner programmers and expert programmers is the way approach & build up projects in careful steps.  You'll get a chance to learn about this in more detail later on, but it's never too late to get started!

## Resources

Awesome learning environments:
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/webpage) - Interactively build cool websites from day 1.  This environment is perfect for getting started, but do move on to Glitch as soon as you're comfortable.
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com) - Use this tool to develop your final projects.  It is a little more challenging up front than something like CodePen, but prepares you for developing locally (on your own computer) and will grow with you (it is capable of running fullstack Node apps).  It also provides convenient live hosting to show off to your friends.
