# JavaScript


The first step towards becoming a code master is to become JavaScript.  

1. Memorize the basic language features in JS.
2. Step through simple scripts exactly like the JS engine does.

Neither of these skills are as easy as the sound, and both of them are the foundation for everything else to come.  Your end goal is to write applications large and small that provide practical solutions to real-world problems, but this is for later.  You won't be able to do this until you've mastered your primary tool - __the JavaScript language__.  

No matter how smart you are, or how good you are at what you did before learning to code, be prepared to struggle.  [This is totally normal](http://elewa.education/2018/01/22/thinking-computer-thoughts/).  Being good at programming (or learning it quickly) are not indicators of how intelligent you are.  They are indicators of how close your thinking style already is to that of a computer programmer.  Learning to program is all about learning new ways of understanding, not learning JavaScript.

_Don't be discouraged!_  If you master these fundamentals now, you will be prepared to learn the principles of software development and real-world problem solving. 

So study hard. Dig in now, and keep at it every day.  The more you prepare, the more everyone will benefit.

## Project

1. Create a new repo called "js-notes" and link to it in your portfolio.  
    * You'll want to build your own 'vocabulary list' to keep track of the built-in JS language features as you come across them.  One of the most common difficulties in the early stages of programming is just remembering all of the language features available!  
    * Having a complete list of everything you know, written in your own words, will be invaluable as you try to start to solve programming challenges on your own.
    * Start building a collection of clear code samples & sketches that have helped you understand key concepts, we recommend trying to store them in a directory of Markdown files.  
2. Complete 'Basic JavaScript' from [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)'s JS Algorithms & Data Structures.  Once you've finished, take a screen shot of your finished screen and paste it in your portfolio.
3. Fork [this replit](https://repl.it/@colevandersWands/consolio) and make a console portfolio.  Link also to this in your portfolio.
4. Continue practice whatever keeps you motivated. If you find one tutorial too easy, hard, or boring, move on!  What's important is that you stay motivated and keep studying, not which tutorials or projects you finish.

Stay involved!  Studying a little bit (even 15 minutes) every day and staying active on Slack will make you life a lot easier.

## Resources

Code visualization and study tools:
* __[Python Tutor](https://github.com/colevandersWands/using-pythontutor):__ Step through code line by line to learn how JS executes your commands.
* __[D.I.Y. Parsons Problems](https://github.com/colevandersWands/parsonizer):__ Turn any snippet of code into a parsons problem to study the logic & meaning without getting caught up in errors.
* __Control Flow Visualization:__ Turn any JS code into a diagram illustrating how data flows through. [Code2flow](https://code2flow.com/app) or [Bogdan Lyashenko](https://bogdan-lyashenko.github.io/js-code-to-svg-flowchart/docs/live-editor/index.html), use the one you prefer.
