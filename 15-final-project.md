## Final Project

(done in pairs)

we find an outstanding css tutorial and they build killer portfolios on replit, it should include a little bio and links to all the projects on their current markdown portfolio.  put a link to the replit on the readme, and copy the portfolio in the un.gh.io repo to make that the live portfolio.  the readme will now just be the readme
