## Working Together

## git & github


* follow --these-- lessons on learngitbranching.org 
    * solo
* fork --this-- repository and complete the steps
    * solo
* you and your partner start new repos and do --these-- pr exercises
    * pair
* link to this repo on your portfolio

end result will be a forked repository with empty but named files, a few branches, and a few releases.  they can see their own git structure on 'network' as well as see where other are at on this project

## JavaScript

* create a new repo called 'fcc-basic-js'.  you will use this readme to take notes on what you learn in fcc
* complete 'basic javascript' on free code camp
    * solo
    * include a screen shot in your repo to show you finished, link to it from your readme
* create a js file called 'fcc-solutions.js' and paste over your solutions to --these-- exercises.  place each one in a block with a console.log label. 
    * pair
    * (preparation for exercise format later on)  
    * (or have each exercise in a different file)  
    * (or have some other little challenge that doesn't come from fcc)
        * i like this idea
        * come up with a nice little exercise or two that fits the later format
        * and even say that this is what's happening
        * maybe a console portfolio?  using template literals and console.logs write a script that replicates much of your portfolio in the console.  use console.md from tressa?  
            * can set things like your name as a variable at the top
            * can recall the function that draws the portfolio
            * can reset variables and recall the function. so it's a terrible function that reads global variables
        * for some extra gimmegimme, get gritty with the devtools
        * develop it in replit, them move it to gh with the html
    * (or it's a thing with pythontutor, links to extra helpful examples?) 
* create an index.html that does nothing but require this script
* put it live on gh-pages so you can easily inspect eachothers solutions
* link to this repo on your portfolio, and separately to the gh-hosting of your consolio

## HTML & CSS

* create a new repo called 'fcc-html-css'. you'll use the readme to take notes (```html ... ```)
* complete the whole html & css in freecodecamp, include a screenshot
    * solo
* copy paste each of your completed fcc html projects into this repo, creating a new file on a new branch before merging & tagging. as with the git/hub exercise
* create a main index.html that links to each of the projects, and put a link back to the index on each project.  decorate said index page to you liking.  turn on gh-pages
    * pair
* link to this repo & the live gh-pages from your portfolio
