## git & github


* follow --these-- lessons on learngitbranching.org 
    * solo
* fork --[this](https://github.com/colevandersWands/githubbing)-- repository and complete the steps. (this is now more of a finished example than project starter)
    * solo
* you and your partner start new repos and do --[these](https://elewa-academy.github.io/Fundamentals/02-all-my-friends/)-- pr exercises. (need to turn this into a free-standing repo)
    * pair
* link to this repo on your portfolio

end result will be a forked repository with empty but named files, a few branches, and a few releases.  they can see their own git structure on 'network' as well as see where other are at on this project
