# GitHub Pages Portfolio

The portfolio is the modern diploma.  During your time with us you will be continually building and perfecting your portfolio. By the end of the course your GitHub account will be a fully navigable portfolio site where employers and collaborators can come to see what you're made of.  

Your portfolio doesn't need to be fancy just yet, a simple README written in markdown is enough.  What's important is that you have somewhere to easily organize and access all of your work. This portfolio is as much for you as it is for other people, it can be a challenge to keep track of all your repositories & projects otherwise.

Your portfolios will also be how you get to know each other. Keep an eye on the #portfolios channel in Slack to see what everyone else is up to!

## Make a GitHub Account

Kind of like FaceBook, Linkedin, the library, and a playground for developers.  

You can develop & collaborate directly on GitHub when you're first learning.  When you're more advanced you'll be able to collaborate in any programming language using GitHub directly from your Terminal.  This is when you know you've made it into the big leagues.

For this first project you'll be building a basic portfolio directly from GitHub's website using Markdown, a very simple language for creating websites. You'll be starting very simple so you can get up and running asap.  The goal here is to have a single place to easily host and organize your projects.  You'll get a chance to make cooler portfolios in some of the later projects.

* [How To](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/create-github-account)

Choosing a user name is important, it will stay with your FOREVER! It should be easy to remember and type, but still represent the true you.

## Markdown

A very simple [markup language](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-markup-languages-3468655) for making pretty (basic) documents.  The syntax is simple and there isn't very much of it.

# GH-Pages Portfolio

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) allows you to host static sites directly from your GitHub repositories. The required project for this precourse is to turn your GitHub account into a one-stop-shop showcase of your skills, each project you build in class will be added to the portfolio you start now. You should all be prepared to introduce yourselves with your portfolios on the first day of class.

At this point, all you need is to write a good README with markdown and use this to keep track of your Precourse project.  For the final step of this precourse, you will be rewriting your portfolio with HTML & CSS.  So keep it simple for now and focus on your studying
